//! smux protocol version 1, client side.
//!
//! The v1 frame layout is identical across the xtaci and sagernet forks:
//! `ver=1, cmd, len u16 LE, stream_id u32 LE, data` (8-byte header,
//! little-endian), no window-update (UPD) flow control — a v1 write just
//! splits into MaxFrameSize frames. Commands: SYN=0, FIN=1, PSH=2, NOP=3;
//! client stream IDs are odd (1, 3, 5, ...). Session defaults match
//! sing-mux's usage (DefaultConfig + KeepAliveDisabled): Version=1,
//! MaxFrameSize=32768, MaxStreamBuffer=64 KiB, MaxReceiveBuffer=4 MiB —
//! the kcptun path overrides frame size, buffers, and keepalive.

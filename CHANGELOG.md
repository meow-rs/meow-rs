## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **BoringSSL is now the only crypto library; rustls is gone from the runtime.**
  Two changes land together. First, every TLS handshake moved off rustls onto
  BoringSSL (`meow_transport::tls::TlsLayer`): proxy handshakes (Trojan, VLESS,
  VMess, HTTP/SOCKS5-over-TLS, SS plugins, ECH tunnel, AnyTLS), URL-test health
  probes, DoT/DoH upstreams, and every internal HTTP(S) fetch (`reqwest`
  removed; the in-tree client gained direct dialing through the host
  resolver/`SocketProtector` hooks, custom headers, and a Content-Length
  precheck). Second, the **Hysteria2 outbound was ported from quinn (rustls) to
  quiche**, Cloudflare's BoringSSL-native QUIC + HTTP/3 stack, using quiche's
  `boringssl-boring-crate` feature so it links the SAME vendored BoringSSL as
  the TLS layer. rustls, tokio-rustls, quinn, h3, h3-quinn, reqwest,
  and webpki-roots are no longer runtime dependencies; rustls remains only as a
  dev-dependency for the loopback TLS test servers.
  **Build change:** the `boring` crate is pinned to `=4.22.0`, the version
  quiche's boring-crate feature accepts (`^4.3`), so that quiche and
  meow-transport share one `links = "boringssl"` copy. 4.22 carries every ECH
  and uTLS API the transport backend uses; `boring-sys` (cmake + a C++ compiler)
  is a hard build requirement on every target. The `boring-tls`/`ech` features
  are no-op aliases. The Hysteria2 quiche client is a single driver task that
  bridges quiche's synchronous state machine to the async `DuplexStream` (TCP)
  and `UdpSession` (UDP datagrams) with real QUIC-flow-control backpressure;
  Salamander obfs and port-hopping are applied on the driver's own UDP socket.
  Observable runtime differences: BoringSSL's default ClientHello replaces
  rustls' for proxies without `client-fingerprint`; TLS session resumption is
  per BoringSSL `SSL_CTX` (64-entry cache); the QUIC ClientHello is now quiche's.

- **`ipv6` is now effective end-to-end and keeps the `false` default.** The
  `ipv6` flag previously only gated a handful of code paths — the resolver
  queried A and AAAA regardless — so the documented `false` default and
  `GET /configs` disagreed with the actual runtime behaviour. The flag now
  drives the whole resolution pipeline: with `ipv6: false` (the default,
  matching mihomo/Clash) AAAA lookups are skipped and the resolver answers
  IPv4-only; with `ipv6: true` dual-stack domains are queried for both A and
  AAAA (concurrently, with IPv4 tried first as a connection fallback) and
  `DirectAdapter` can fall back to IPv6 when IPv4 connectivity fails. The
  default literal is now centralized in `meow_config::effective_ipv6`
  (previously scattered across six `unwrap_or(...)` sites), and the parser,
  `GET /configs`, and `website/guide/configuration.md` all agree on `false`.
  **Operators who relied on the old always-dual-stack behaviour of an
  omitted `ipv6` key must now set `ipv6: true` explicitly.**

- DNS dual-stack resolution (`resolve_ips` / `lookup_ip_with_ipv6_inner`) now
  queries A and AAAA **concurrently** when IPv6 is enabled, collecting both
  address families with IPv4 ordered first. `DirectAdapter::dial_tcp` iterates
  the full address list, so an IPv4 connect failure no longer discards the IPv6
  candidate — IPv6 remains a connection fallback.

### Fixed

- Hysteria2 authentication no longer advertises HTTP/3 datagrams, preventing
  the server's HTTP/3 receiver from consuming raw QUIC UDP relay packets.
  The TProxy test image now includes the mandatory BoringSSL build toolchain.
- Internal HTTP downloads strip authentication and cookie headers when a
  redirect changes origin, and reject bodies that do not match Content-Length
  before replacing provider caches.
- Hysteria2 bounds queued TCP writes by bytes, retries exhausted QUIC stream
  limits without discarding requests, and propagates terminal stream errors.
  Restored idle keepalive and the remote response wait for `fast-open: false`;
  cancelling authentication or dropping a client releases its driver socket.
- **Auto-created `GLOBAL` selectors now default to the config's primary
  outbound.** Global mode always dispatches through `GLOBAL`, but the implicit
  selector previously sorted every registry key and used the first one when no
  choice was stored. That made global mode silently select `DIRECT` or route
  through an alphabetically-first quota/expiry pseudo-node. The generated
  selector still lists every proxy for mihomo-compatible dashboards, while its
  first member is now the final valid `MATCH` target, falling back to the first
  declared group or leaf proxy. Explicit user-defined `GLOBAL` groups remain
  unchanged.
- **AnyTLS UDP no longer deadlocks against sing-box/mihomo inbounds**
  (#535). sing-box reads the udp-over-tcp request before reporting handshake
  success, so the stream SYNACK is gated on the request arriving — while the
  client waited for SYNACK first and only sent the request lazily with the
  first datagram, leaving both sides waiting until the dial timed out. The
  UoT request is now flushed on the stream-open path, ahead of the SYNACK
  wait (`Client::create_proxy_stream_with_payload`); ordinary TCP streams
  and the vendored server's unconditional-SYNACK shape are unchanged. The
  same ordering fix was applied to the vendored `Client::create_udp_proxy`
  for consistency.

- **`merge_family` no longer revives an expired sibling family.** When a new
  A answer merged into an entry whose AAAA had already expired, the old code
  unconditionally marked AAAA as `queried`, which `family_hit()` then read as a
  fresh `NoData`, suppressing re-resolution of AAAA. The sibling is now only
  carried forward when its own answer is still fresh; an expired sibling stays
  a `Miss` so the resolver re-queries it on demand.

- **`resolve_ips` no longer short-circuits when one family is cached.** A
  single-family cache entry (e.g. A already fresh, AAAA still `Miss`) no longer
  prevents the missing family from being queried. Only already-fresh families
  are dropped from the query set; the missing required family is always
  fetched, preserving `DirectAdapter`'s cross-family fallback.

- **`GET /configs` reports the same `ipv6` default the runtime uses.** The API
  previously reported `ipv6: false` for an unset config while the runtime
  actually queried AAAA anyway, causing UIs/controllers to display a state the
  resolver ignored. Both sides now share `meow_config::effective_ipv6` and
  default to `false` — and the reported value is the one actually enforced.

- **A fast NXDOMAIN no longer suppresses a slow positive answer.** Within a
  single nameserver tier, the first definitive negative (NODATA/NXDOMAIN) is
  now held for a short grace period while the remaining upstreams keep racing;
  a positive answer arriving later always wins. This restores correct
  behaviour for split-horizon / multi-upstream configurations. Network errors
  (`Err`) are not treated as definitive and never short-circuit the pool.

- **Single-flight broadcast misses no longer surface as SERVFAIL.** A
  subscriber that attached just after the publisher sent (and removed its
  inflight slot) previously received `Closed` and could be judged `Failed`.
  `lookup_real_with_ttl` now re-reads the cache on a missed broadcast, so the
  already-merged result is served instead of a transient SERVFAIL.

- **DoH response bodies are now size-capped.** `doh_exchange` previously
  `read_to_end`-ed an unbounded buffer, letting a misbehaving or hostile
  upstream drive unbounded heap growth. Responses are now rejected once they
  exceed the DNS message maximum (65535 B) plus HTTP header headroom.

- **`snapshot()` hides IPs of an expired family.** When one family is still
  fresh and the other has expired, only the fresh family's IPs appear in the
  cache snapshot panel.

- **Hosts-table AAAA answers follow the global `ipv6` switch.** An AAAA query
  for a domain present in the hosts trie is gated by `ipv6` exactly like every
  other AAAA path: with `ipv6: false` it returns NODATA even when the hosts
  file carries an IPv6 address for the domain (the entry remains reachable for
  A queries and for `ipv6: true` configs). This keeps the global toggle a
  single, predictable switch — dual-stack operators who pin addresses in
  `hosts:` must enable `ipv6: true` for the v6 entries to be served.
